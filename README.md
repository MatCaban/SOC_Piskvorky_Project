# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

---

This project is a simple implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe game**, developed as part of the **StreetOfCode - Java** course. It provides a basic console-based game experience where two players automatically take turns placing their marks on the game board.

## How to Play

The game features an automated turn-taking system. Players place their marks on the board by entering their desired coordinates.

**Key features include:**

* **Automatic Player Switching:** After each move, the game automatically switches to the next player.
* **Win Condition Check:** The program checks for a winner after every turn. If no winner is found, the game continues with the next player.
* **Input Validation:** The game includes robust input validation. It will notify players if they enter an invalid input (e.g., non-numeric characters, out-of-bounds coordinates) or attempt to place a mark on an already occupied field.
